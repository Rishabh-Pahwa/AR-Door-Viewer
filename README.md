# AR-Door-Viewer
A cross platform (iOS &amp; Android) web app that renders Images of doors in an AR enviroment.

Used threejs for the 3D part. Created a plane and mapped the image onto it.
Used ar.js(location based) for the AR experience.
Chose ar.js as it supports both WebGL & WebRTC.
Faked the location to make the location based experience as a markerless approach.


Doors can be viewed in preset sizes or a custom size.


V 1.5.0
Users can fix the door at its postion by the press of a button.
